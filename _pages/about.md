Hello, my name is Travis Amiel. I'm a senior theatre studies major at Emerson College in Boston.

I mostly make theatre.
But I am also interested in climate change, painting, web/software development, comedy, collaging, making music, public transportation, dismantling systematic racism and inequality, copyright law, and juxtaposition.

I use Evernote as a second brain, and you are [free to explore that part of my brain](https://www.evernote.com/pub/travisamiel/beautyportfolio). When I see something beautiful (like an artwork), or have a quote I want to share, I put it in this public Evernote notebook.
